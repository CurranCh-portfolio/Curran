# About Me
### History
I got my bachelors degree in Pyschology and my masters degree in Human Factors Engineering. A lot of people don't understand why I did a "big jump" in career feilds, but I dont believe it is that odd. Engineers create things for people to use. Psychology studies how people react. My degree merges the two and helps determine what the reaction will be to the engineered thing. I am very excited to put this education into use for my professional life and my projects on this site.
